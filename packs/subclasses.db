You are considered to be proficient with these gizmos and knickknacks, but suffer disadvantage when trying to use them to improvise a function (like a pump or similar devices). Your scientific equipment grants you your science dice. If you ever lose your scientific equipment, you cannot use any ability that uses science dice until you regain your scientific equipment. You can replenish it in one day of shopping, costing 5 gp x your HD.</p>\n<p><strong>Svirf Science.</strong> You learn three tricks of the svirf science of your choice, which are detailed under “Svirf Science” below. Many types of svirf science enhance another action in some way. You can use only one svirf science trick per attack. You learn two additional svirf science tricks of your choice at 7th, 10th and 15th level. Each time you learn a new svirf science, you can also replace one svirf science you know with a different one. You are proficient with all types of svirf science you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Science Dice.</strong> You have four science dice, which are d8. A science die is expended when you use it. You regain all your expended science dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another science die at 7th level and 15th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws.</strong> Some of your svirf science tricks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the svirf science’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><sup>Svirf Science DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (your choice).</sup></p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.Gy8GwgRwm8gXg8N2]{It's Science}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.PCVczJhMzpf08IQp]{Svirf Science}</p>\n<h5>Academic Fieldworker</h5>\n<p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with 2 types of tools of your choice.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.QMGsbryWWQXu7jd0]{Academic Fieldworker}</p>\n<h5>Chemical Stamina</h5>\n<p>At 9th level, your explorations have yielded a sufficient amount of odd samples, from strange rhizomes to troll’s brains to allow you to create a unique, tailor-made diet of potions, draughts and pills that enhances your health and endurance. You may add your Intelligence modifier in place of your Constitution modifier to your hit point total at each level, as well as when expending Hit Dice to recover hit points. This effect is retroactive to 1st level.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.KNvhrvhmZLp53l9i]{Chemical Stamina}</p>\n<h5>Mutation</h5>\n<p>At 13th level, you have ingested your fair share of strange substances and concoctions and have begun developing a latent mutation in your own body. You can use your action and expend one or more science die or dice to cause this mutation to trigger a combination of effects that combine alter self, false life and your choice of either enhance ability’s bear’s endurance, bull’s strength or cat’s grace, with the crucial difference that the mutation lasts for 1 hour and does not require concentration to maintain. Since the mutation is not a magical effect, it cannot be dispelled. The effects are at their minimum spell level, but for each science die beyond the first you use to activate this ability, you treat all of the effects as though you had cast them using one spell slot higher than their minimum. While you are subject to the mutation, you suffer disadvantage on all ability checks using two of your mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) of your choice. You can only be affected by one mutation at any given time.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.MrQo9jZPsVoyGIJi]{Mutation}</p>\n<h5>Deadly Mutation</h5>\n<p>At 17th level, your mutation capability is greatly enhanced. You choose two of the following enhance ability effects on each activation: bear’s endurance, bull’s strength or cat’s grace. Additionally, you add regeneration to the effects of your mutation and you only suffer disadvantage on all ability checks using one of your mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) of your choice. Additionally, when you roll initiative and have no science dice remaining, you regain 1 science die.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.dqJWHewZK7eyhj5j]{Deadly Mutation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"AAW","identifier":"svirf-scientist","classIdentifier":"rogue","advancement":[{"_id":"59gbzojo07xfpakm","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.PCVczJhMzpf08IQp","Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.Gy8GwgRwm8gXg8N2","Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.QMGsbryWWQXu7jd0"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":""},{"_id":"7ti2rh0sbidp6a5p","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.KNvhrvhmZLp53l9i"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":9,"title":"Features","icon":""},{"_id":"cnsd55t26en1rktp","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.MrQo9jZPsVoyGIJi"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":13,"title":"Features","icon":""},{"_id":"tkkbrxey4rdhnb0j","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.dqJWHewZK7eyhj5j"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":17,"title":"Features","icon":""},{"_id":"wwm9sixc2zb2qmic","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"string","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"3":{"value":"4"},"7":{"value":"5"},"15":{"value":"6"}}},"value":{},"title":"Science Dice","icon":""},{"_id":"5mn418aym9xku1t3","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"3":{"n":1,"die":8}}},"value":{},"title":"Science Die","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"5vlmE3uiS7OIQTEf":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"c606539e1cb6b472c792dd2885bb55adae0522d5","sourceId":"Item.fNH2j9yN5OuTc4P0"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.fNH2j9yN5OuTc4P0"}}}

Up to two allies, one of which may be yourself, who are currently wielding a poisonous weapon or who are suffering from the poisoned condition, may spend their reactions to make an attack with their weapons. If these attacks hit, they add your Wisdom modifier to the damage dealt. At 11th level, allies (or yourself) who hit with this attack deal an additional 1d8 poison damage on a hit. At 17th level, allies (or yourself) who hit with this attack deal an additional 2d8 poison damage.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.apZZcIw6q7QOP6Ro]{Channel Divinity: Poisonous Cunning}</p>\n<h5>Pure Spite</h5>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, whenever you are below half of your maximum hit points and suffering from either the grappled, poisoned or prone conditions due to the actions of an enemy that has not yet been vanquished, you may treat any result of 1 or 2 as a 3 on dice you roll to determine damage or healing effects for attacks you execute and spells you cast. This immediately ends if the foe is brought to 0 HP or if the condition ends.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.qy6StE0d0BSYdVqH]{Pure Spite}</p>\n<h5>Poisonous Shadows</h5>\n<p>Starting at 8th level, whenever you would lose your shadow due to an effect, spell or similar circumstance, you may use your reaction to regrow your shadow and negate any and all negative effects associated with having no shadow. Additionally, any beneficial spell or ability that requires the use of your shadow that may currently be in effect is not ended by this, allowing you to potentially have more than one spell or ability that uses your shadow in effect at any given time. You can use this feature again after completing a short rest. Furthermore, as a reaction to being poisoned or to suffering poison damage, you can siphon poison coursing through your veins into your shadow, immediately ending any ongoing poison damage and the poisoned condition. You are still treated as poisoned for the purpose of this domain’s abilities for as long as your shadow that absorbed the poison persists. Abrupt exposure to total darkness or magical light ends this boon. Your shadow may only hold one poison at any given time. If your shadow holds a poison and you complete a long rest, it is no longer considered to be holding poison.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.i73OpnYHkrNq3I3M]{Poisonous Shadows}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"AAW","identifier":"naraneus-domain","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[{"_id":"4vsu8f0dh3lnmluj","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.vVFcLgQDpqalkz3c","Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.gyg4v7YlQK2DFON2"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":""},{"_id":"fhhmu3rpvtq9tc0p","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.apZZcIw6q7QOP6Ro"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":""},{"_id":"r4o5h3tc31ih5k6g","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.qy6StE0d0BSYdVqH"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":""},{"_id":"u6stz9fhqv05vz2a","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.i73OpnYHkrNq3I3M"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"Features","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"5vlmE3uiS7OIQTEf":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"20d72677473427ebc2ec5338ab60a697d8824ca2","sourceId":"Item.gh5xp8mluc8vCIDw"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.gh5xp8mluc8vCIDw"}}}

By touching a mushroom, you can imbue it with limited sentience, allowing it to communicate with you. You can question fungi about events within 30 feet of their location that have transpired within the day, gleaning information about creatures that have passed, weather, and similar circumstances. You also become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Insight, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.

Explosive caps are drawn as part of the Attack action. You gain a total number of explosive caps equal to twice your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. Explosive caps last for 1 day or until you complete a long rest before withering and becoming inert. Thrown explosive caps detonate and cannot be salvaged after combat. You treat explosive caps as simple ranged weapons with the finesse and thrown (range 20/60) properties. You are proficient with explosive caps.

When you throw an explosive cap, it detonates and leaves behind a wispy cloud of spores that lasts until the end of your next turn. The cloud is a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the target and it does not impede sight. As an action on your turn, you can will the spores to coalesce on a target currently within the cloud of spores that you can see. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, it experiences strange hallucinations and must roll a d10 on the hallucinogenic Visions table below:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-tables.2mkwA7tVU9isojx6]{Hallucinogenic Visions}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[aaw-aventyr.aaw-classfeatures.P2nYOGo4E6bhXbj3]{Hallucinogenic Visions}</p>\n<h5>Potent Visions</h5>\n<p>At 8th level, any creature affected by your hallucinogenic visions must roll twice on the table.
