Upon casting this spell and for each round beyond the first that you maintain it, you also expend a use of your hypnotic gaze ability. The spell’s effects supersede those granted by your hypnotic gaze while it persists. If you no longer have uses of your hypnotic gaze ability left, the spell ends, but not its effects (see below). Each round, make a ranged spell attack against a target in range as you focus your dire gaze on the hapless victims. On a hit, you may choose one of the following effects:</p>\n<p><strong>Debase.</strong> The creature is affected as though targeted by bestow curse, but suffers disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature may only be affected in this way by one gaze of nothingness at a time. A remove curse spell ends this effect. This effect has a duration of 8 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Renounce.</strong> The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw or audibly cries out against their faith, insulting the god(s) they worship with blasphemies. Divine spellcasters (like clerics and paladins) have advantage on this saving throw, but on a failure lose access to their spellcasting, supernatural, and innate spellcasting abilities for 1d4+2 rounds. Failing this save by 5 or more increases the duration to 2d4+2 rounds, and failure by 10 or more may leave the creature with more significant repercussions, subject to a GM’s approval.</p>\n<p><strong>Unmake.</strong> There is no immediate effect. The target makes its Wisdom saving throw in the middle of its rest the next time it takes a short or long rest. On a failure, the creature sleepwalks, gaining darkvision 60 feet and makes Dexterity (Stealth) checks at an advantage, attempting to attack allies before ultimately killing itself. Each time the enchanted creature proceeds to attack a target while sleepwalking, it receives a Wisdom saving throw to wake up, though for each failed saving throw, the DC to wake up increases by +1.</p>\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you get one free round of effects per spell slot used above 5th. During such a round you do not need to expend a use of your hypnotic gaze ability.

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature, ” “Run over there, ” or “Fetch that object. ” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do.
