While you do look normal, you’ve had massive surgery done on your scarred head. As a reaction to dying due to hit point damage, you may expend any number of science dice. Roll the dice and multiply them with one another. If the total of the result of the multiplication exceeds the number of excess damage you have taken from the attack that has killed you, your head pops open as your brain-in-a-jar is propelled from your body, landing at a point you designate within 100 feet.

The container can fire a limited array of magic missiles, one use of the spell per science die expended when firing your brain from your body. The effective spell slot used is also equal to the number of science dice expended— if you expend 3 science dice, for example, the magic missile would behave as if cast as a third level spell.
